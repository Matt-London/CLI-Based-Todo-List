# CLI-Based-Todo-List
A basic command line todo list that can store tasks and repeat them back later.


Run the installer to install the program. Make sure you enter actual paths or you might mess up the install. I recommend entering nothing for the launcher path and sticking with the default of "\usr\bin"

To uninstall simply delete the folder: toDo which lives in the path that you specified first. Then delete the launcher, if not in usr/bin then wherever you specified the second path.

Note: Uninstaller coming soon, probably in a week or so

Also note: I am aware that the ascii art that reads "toDo" is a little sloppy. I used an ascii art generator to make it and then I wasn't careful with a replace all command. I think it looks cool, so I left it alone.

Enjoy!
