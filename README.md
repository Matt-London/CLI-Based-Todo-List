# CLI-Based-Todo-List
A basic command line todo list that can store tasks and repeat them back later.

To use this program I first recommend placing the following files in a safe place in the same folder: Main.py, Item.py, save.task.
After this you should note the path to the files mentioned above and insert the path within the file named toDo right before the pound symbol that reads "# Insert full path to files here". Finally place the file named toDo somewhere that your $PATH environment variable reaches to and type "chmod +x toDo". This way you can launch the program anywhere in the filesystem.

Note: I will be pushing an update within the coming week, it will include an installer that will make installation far easier.

Also note: I am aware that the ascii art that reads "toDo" is a little sloppy. I used an ascii art generator to make it and then I wasn't careful with a replace all command. I think it looks cool, so I left it alone.

Enjoy!
